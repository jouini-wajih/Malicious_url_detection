# Malicious URL Detection

## Introduction

In today's digital age, the increasing use of online services has led to a surge in cyber threats. Among these, malicious URLs pose a significant risk to both users and organizations. These URLs can contain harmful content such as spam, malware, and phishing attempts, jeopardizing online security and data privacy. To combat this growing threat, integrating machine learning algorithms for detecting malicious URLs has emerged as a promising approach.

## Problem Statement

Malicious URLs are a rising threat in the digital landscape, often used to distribute malware, launch phishing attacks, and perpetrate online fraud. These URLs compromise data privacy and the security of IT systems, posing significant challenges despite existing security measures. The primary problem to address is developing an advanced detection system capable of accurately identifying and classifying these online threats, thereby protecting users from potential cyberattacks.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collect and preprocess data related to URLs, preparing it for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identify and extract key features from URLs that could indicate malicious intent.
- **Model Development:** Develop a machine learning model to detect and classify malicious URLs.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
